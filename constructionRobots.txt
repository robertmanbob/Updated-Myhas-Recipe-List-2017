      notes: |
             Cyborg parts are classified as light, standard, sturdy or heavy. Durability increases with heavier parts, but mobility decreases. Overweight cyborgs will also use slightly more power.
             
             For the most part, the game will prevent you from inserting unsuitable (job-banned etc.) brains automatically. If you use an AI interface board instead of a brain, the AI will be able to assume control of the cyborg body at will.
             
             Remove limbs: use the wrench on the frame, then select the appropriate cyborg part.
             Remove brain: detach the cyborg head first, then click on it with the wrench.

             Medbots will detect nearby people and inject them with helpful drugs to slowly bring them back to health. They are a supplement to medical doctors, not a replacement. When emagged, the medbot will enthusiastically inject everyone with massive amounts of poison regardless of injury or not.
             Medbots may also be produced outright at a robotics fabricator or ordered from the cargo bay.

  - name: Floorbot
    unsorted: true
    tags: [make, robot, floor]
    ingredients:
      - Empty <Toolbox (Mechanical)>
      - Proximity Sensor
      - <Cyborg arm (Standard)> (left or right)
      - Floor tile
      - !step Use the floor tile on the empty toolbox.
      - !step Use the proximity sensor to finish the robot. 
      - !step Use the cyborg arm on the resulting assembly.
    info:
      notes: |
              Floorbots will detect nearby areas of space and tirelessly use their very finite supply of floor tiles to turn it into walkable floors. When emagged, floorbots will rip up floors equally as tirelessly, quickly turning habitable parts of a station into cold, airless tombs. Floorbots may also be produced outright at a robotics fabricator (where they will spawn with 10 tiles) or ordered from the cargo bay.
             
              If you use more than 10 floor tiles, the finished floorbot will have however many you put in. If you use less than 10, the floorbot will have 10. Therefore, it is most efficient to use 1-2 in creation and load the rest after the floorbot is done.

      - !step Use the fire extinguisher on the resulting assembly.
      - !step Optionally, you may use a pen to rename the finished robot.
      - !step Use the proximity sensor to finish the robot. 
    info:
      notes: Firebots will detect nearby fires, whether on tiles or on people, and put them out. When emagged, firebots will ram anyone nearby, knocking them down with surprising efficiency. Firebots may also be produced outright at a robotics fabricator or ordered from the cargo bay.

  - name: Cambot
    tags: [make, robot]
    ingredients:
      - Camera
      - Proximity Sensor	  
      - <Cyborg arm (Standard)> (left or right)
      - !step Attach the cyborg arm to the camera.
    info:
      notes: Smile for the camera! Essentially slightly less annoying tourists, cambots leisurely roam around the station, occasionally taking pictures of just about anything they see. When emagged, their photographic flash works like an actual flash, stunning cyborgs and humans for quite some time. 

  - name: Amusing duck
    tags: [make, robot]
    ingredients:
      - Bike horn
      - <Cyborg arm (Standard)> (left or right)
      - !step Combine the bike horn with the robot arm.
    info:
      notes: |
             Amusing ducks will slowly move around at random, quacking and emitting a playful jingle. They will occasionally lay eggs (similar, but not identical to Easter eggs), which in turn may contain fun items.
             
             When emagged, they lay eggs and quack more frequently. However, they will also play their jingle on dissonant chords, giving them a distinctly 'wrong' and slightly unsettling sound. Amusing ducks can be colossally annoying when a lot of them are stacked into a small area and can easily inspire some to violence to make the quacking stop.

  - name: Chefbot
    tags: [make, robot]
    ingredients:
      - Dramatic bike horn
      - <Cyborg arm (Standard)> (left or right)

      - !step Click 'Toggle Power' to switch off the MULE.
      - !step Use the screwdriver to open the maintenance panel.
      - !step Click on the MULE with an empty hand to access the hacking GUI.
      - !step Pulse the wires with the multitool to figure out what they do.
      - !step Cut the appropiate cables with the wirecutters.
      - !step Close the maintenance panel with the screwdriver.
      - !step Click 'Toggle Power' to switch on the MULE.
      - !step Lock the MULE's interface with your ID card or EMAG.
    info:
      notes: |
             Once you've opened the maintenance panel, pulse the wires to figure out their function and then bypass the safety by cutting the corresponding cables. They are randomized for every bot.
             
             Power cell = Click this with an empty hand to remove the cell for recharging or upgrading.
             
             You hear a radio crackle. = Leave those wires alone. Used for navigation and to interface with PDAs.
             
             The charge light flickers. =  Leave as is. Both wires need to be intact or the bot will be immobilized.
             
             The load platform clunks. =  Pointless. Out of the box, any type of cargo can be loaded onto the MULE now.
             
             The drive motor whines briefly. = Disables the speed limiter. Highly recommended, but make sure to only cut one of the two wires!
             
             The external warning lights flash briefly. = When cut, the machine will knock and run over anybody in its path. This wire has no impact as far as prone people are concerned, as the MULE never tries to avoid them.
