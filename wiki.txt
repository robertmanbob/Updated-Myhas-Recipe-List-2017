    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      penetrates_skin: No
      application_effect: 10+ UNITS = Creates piles of magnesium when applied to floor tiles.
      notes: Piles ignite when exposed to a temperature higher than 747 K, but the fire isn't hot enough to set alight non-flammable materials or burn through the floor. They do however also ignite nearby piles, so you could make a line of magnesium and use it as a fuse for other pyrotechnic reagents.

                          TOUCH - Heals 1 BRUTE per unit applied. Can reduce BLEEDING by up to 5.
                          
                          INGEST - Causes 0.5 TOX per unit ingested.
      notes: The go-to BRUTE medication. It depletes rapidly in the blood, so most of your healing will come upfront from a topical application. Ingesting it doesn't work nearly as well and even causes a fair bit of TOX damage, so don't do that.

             Fairly similar to epinephrine but will rapidly push deep-crit damage levels towards shallow crit levels. Use this if you find someone who is right at the edge of death. Flushes sarin extremely rapidly.

      notes: |
             One of the most debilitating chems in the game due to applying brain damage, confusion and constant knockouts all at once. Someone given a large dose will be lucky to be able to do anything.
             Its delayed effects make it one of the quickest and stealthiest knockout chems around. It's also one of horrible things that changelings can sting you with.

      notes: |
             This essentially lets you play possum. You're unable to speak (excluding telepathy or machine talk), but you can make yourself appear dead in a pinch.
             Know someone is hunting you? Inject yourself with this just before they find you, lay down and they'll mistake you for a corpse! You retain full consciousness and control of your body, so you can back up and ambush them when they least suspect it.

                 Delayed, dose-specific. On the last cycle that it's in you, it hits you with a stack of TOX damage based on elapsed cycles * rand(2,4).
                 The more you use, the longer it takes before anything happens, but the harder it hits when it does.
      notes: This is a stealth poison. With large doses your target can consume something poisoned, walk around for a few minutes minding their own business, and then abruptly die with no real warning. Very devious to use.

      notes: |
             A couple of common chem recipes can produce this if poorly mixed, and production of cyanide will dose nearby people if they aren't wearing gas masks.
             Also a fairly easy poison. Balanced to be mostly a slow and scary killer, but if they get to medbay, it's not that hard to deal with. Suffocation damage can rack up faster than TOX depending on how the RNG rolls.

      notes: |
             Like an incredibly fast-acting ketamine, but with slightly slower depletion; it also doesn't knock out for nearly as long once the chem wears off.

      notes: |
             You may be familiar with Syndicate NPCs, which can be summoned with telescience. Rajaijah makes use of the same AI, which is quite robust. It can pick up, attack with and throw items from off the floor, can use firearms effectively, and is hard to pacify thanks to the stamina buff.
             Injecting somebody with this poison will KO them briefly after a couple of cycles. Once they wake up, the AI assumes control of the mob, turning the victim into an involuntary murder machine. They'll be unable to do anything about it until the poison wears off.
             
             Note - Slapping a straight jacket on someone poisoned with rajaijah will neutralize them, letting you flush the poison safely.

      notes: |
             Royal initro essentially turns the victim's heart into a monstrous bee bearing their name. A very reliable killing method, though at least 5 units are required for a guaranteed kill and the giant red bee bearing the name of the victim is a huge red flag for the crew.

             It takes up to three other chems (the ones with the most units present) from its container with it, inflicting their TOUCH reactions and making them breathable through the air (gives them "Penetrates Skin = Yes" functionality) for whatever is hit by the smoke. Very handy for delivering chemicals that otherwise need to be injected to work.
             
             Wearing active internals or a gas mask will prevent you from inhaling chemical smoke. Even if an acid is employed in the smoke to destroy the active internals or gas mask, the victim still won't suck in anything from that specific cloud of smoke.

      Ignition effect: |
                       Turns into foam when combined with water, causes people to slip on it if they're running.
                       The amount of foam made (up to 7x7) depends on how much fluorosurfactant and water are used, but every tile is capped at 3 units (per reagent carried with the foam, not in total).
      notes: |
             Unlike smoke powder, foam isn't limited to three chems and inflicts TOUCH reactions from everything it takes with it, though they won't penetrate skin unless they're supposed to.
             
             Most non-backbreaking methods of creating foam require you to do it by hand and thus be in the middle of the reaction, so unless you're trying to die, take appropriate measures to survive your own disaster.

      depletion_rate: unknown
      penetrates_skin: unknown
      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: What's happening to the objects? Take this into consideration.
      Described effect: Brings inanimate objects to life to attack people, gives odd visions when injected.
      notes: The bigger the object you animate, the more health it has and damage it does, though smaller objects can be harder to click. What Anima actually affects is a bit all over the place, but if it can be dragged, assume it can be animated. The means for mixing this are nonstandard and guaranteed to be harmful, be advised!

      depletion_rate: unknown
      penetrates_skin: unknown
      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: Do a little research on real life enzymes
      Described effect: Duplicates certain beneficial chemicals in your bloodstream.
      notes: Each time booster enzyme decays, it will create 2 units of any beneficial medical chem that's already in your body up to a cap of 20 - note that this does not proc overdose thresholds of 20 or higher (but it will for lower thresholds!). A neat tool for farming rarer medicinal reagents, or for making you nigh-immortal with said reagents.

      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: It's just like making silver fulminate in real life.
      Described effect: Ridiculously sensitive gimmick chem that makes a gunshot-like pop when it's set off. It's even more sensitive than nitroglycerin; at least nitro doesn't explode under the weight of other nitro molecules. 
      notes: Like spiders, it's not quite a secret chem in of itself, but it uses many of the same precursors to one.

      Described effect: Heals 1 OXY/TOX/LOSEBREATH and 3 BRUTE/BURN per cycle.
      Components: 12
      notes: Pretty much super-omnizine, with more addiction and custom flavor texts if you overdose. Far and away the best healing chem in the game short of stimulants. 

  - name: Fermid

      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: Consider the name "fermid" and what a fermid looks like.
      Described effect: Creates a hostile fermid at the point of reaction.
      notes: Fermids are the nasty critters that plagued the (now removed) mining z-level, being stubbornly durable and injecting any human they see with harmful toxins; fortunately they cannot target cyborgs. The recipe used to be laughably easy, but after seeing the harm spontaneous fermid swarms could cause, it was wisely made more difficult and thrown into secrets section. DO NOT SPAM THESE AS A NON-ANTAGONIST.

      Hint: The name is a strong hint in and of itself. Notably, this is not found in poison bottles like its bigger cousin.
      Described effect: Turns your heart into a memorial bee and makes it fly away.
      Components: 4
      notes: You'll know if someone was hit by this if they start turning yellow. For the victim, they'll get big red messages of their heart fluttering in their chest. This is a disease reagent, so it only needs to be in you a certain amount of cycles to infect you, which will eventually lead to the heart-bee evicting itself from your body and leave you with cardiac abscondment.

      Described effect: Makes you unstunnable, very robust, and very dizzy.
      Components: 1
      notes: Taking this will cause your stamina regeneration to rise to obscene levels. The movement confusion can be limiting, but otherwise there is no better drug for laughing off stuns and stamina loss, and the added movement speed makes you pretty hard to click. Addictive. Has a secret use.

      depletion_rate: unknown
      penetrates_skin: unknown
      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: Think about stuff that could be used to produce power.
      Described effect: Randomly targets nearby mobs with arc flashes when in the bloodstream (consuming every remaining unit) or instantly if mixed without stabilizing agent.
      Components: 4(+ Stabilizer)
      notes: Found in shock grenades and just as useful for crowd control. Arc flashes will stun and damage anyone who aren't wearing insulated gloves, so if you can nab a pair, popping a pill of this can give you a huge advantage when fighting another player.

    info:
      depletion_rate: unknown
      penetrates_skin: unknown
      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: If you can figure out voltagen, the remaining two ingredients should be quite obvious.
      Described effect: Stun reduction, minor stamina regeneration buff, speed boost, chance to cause jitteriness. Overdose may cause cardiac failure. May cause various bad effects on depletion
      Components: 3
      notes: Basically the energy drink from the future, with just as mean of a crash. Despite this it's a welcome alternative to methamphetamine since it has next-to-none of its cons... just don't overdose on it. Addictive.

    info:
      depletion_rate: unknown
      penetrates_skin: unknown
      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: Do some research on real nitroglycerin.
      Described effect: Liquid explosive with an incredibly foul temperament. The slightest jostle can set this stuff off, with its power ranging from minor to vicious depending on the reagent volume. Woe betide anyone who gets too much of it in their bloodstream, as any subsequent attack will instantly gib them in a violent blast!
      Components: 3
      notes: Don't try to use it in smoke or foam. Bad things happen.

      penetrates_skin: unknown
      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: Ahaha, no. There will be no hints given for this abomination. You're on your own.
      Described effect: Gibs any people it touches, destroys most items and critters it touches, deletes walls and floors on contact.
      Components: I have no clue.
      notes: Just to prove that there's no such thing as overkill in SS13. QGP is pure liquid destruction, it comes into existence as a massive sea of foam that obliterates anything in its path - people, Pods, critters, floors and walls, you name it. DO NOT EVER USE THIS AS A NON-ANTAGONIST ON THE STATION Z-LEVEL.

  - name: Glowing Fliptonium

    info:
      depletion_rate: unknown
      penetrates_skin: unknown
      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: One of the ingredients is fliptonium! The other four make it glow, make it more powerful, and a little bit trippy and spooky.
      Described effect: Works like regular fliptonium, with the exception that it affects mobs, objects and turfs on application, as opposed to just mobs and objects. It also gives more stun resistance/stamina buff/etc than normal fliptonium.
      Components: 3
      notes: The recipe is intended to be difficult to make, not to figure out, really. The effect is pretty crazy and does far more to interrupt peoples' rounds than, say, colorful reagent or glitter.

      penetrates_skin: unknown
      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: Do some research on real owls... no, I'm just messing.
      Described effect: Has a stable and unstable variant. The stable one gives you an owl suit and mask that you can't take off yourself. The unstable one... well, it's a little more violent.
      Components: 6 / 6
      notes: The unstable variant has some utility as a pseudo-deathchem. Also, owl masks don't work as internals. Use that as you will.

      per_cycle: unknown
      Hint: Cold chems. What makes you freeze?
      Described effect: Decays into ethanol. Lowers your body temperature and inflicts brief stuns and burn damage. Severe effect scales with volume [0.1% * volume] chance of being turned into an ice statue.
      Components: 5
      notes: Functionally the same as Dragon's Breath, but it freezes you to death instead of frying you.
